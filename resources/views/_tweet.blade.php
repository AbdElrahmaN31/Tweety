        <p class="text-sm">In the dark , We come out and play We are its children, And were here to stay Running through , Hungry for strays No invitation, take me away Im not cruel, But thats still what you see Club to club, Come see this city with me Hungry for life, Without your pity I dont want it, But you give it</p>
